## Wiki

The documentation can be consulted [here](). There you will find information from first steps to system architecture design choices.

## Context

This platform was developed has the final project for the [Programming for IoT applications]() subject taught at __Politecnico di Torino__. The project took about two months of full daily work. At the starting of the project I only knew [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), Javascript and code based projects management skills, so all the technology user in this project was ether researched or learned in the classes.

## Status

The project is definitely __not ready for production__. The platform is incomplete and it not will be supported. There are a lot of lose ends that need to be improved and it's too much work for one person alone. Feel free to improve and contribute to the project, but take in account that this platform is public for learning purposes.
