# Broker

The MQTT Broker is handled by an docker image of the eclipse [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) broker. The configuration is the default one.
There are plans to add [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) support, but the time constrains make it impossible for now.
